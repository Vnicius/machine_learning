#Welcome to my Machine Learning Toolbox

- `ml_basic_toolkit`: simple and lightweight reference for using the scikit learn library
- `map_reduce`: Using MRJob to build scalable ML algos.
- `deep_learning`: Deep Learning with Octave.

See `map_reducedocs/stratified_sampling` for a simple presentation given during Mike Bowles's class @ Hacker Dojo "Machine Learning on BigData using MapReduce".
